Test what happens when melange.emit stanza depends on non-Melange libraries

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.6)
  > (using melange 0.1)
  > EOF

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (melange.emit
  >  (target output)
  >  (entries main_melange)
  >  (libraries foo)
  >  (module_system commonjs))
  > (executable
  >  (name main_native)
  >  (modules main_native)
  >  (libraries foo)
  >  (modes native byte_complete))
  > EOF

  $ cat > main_melange.ml <<EOF
  > let t = Foo_Bar.t
  > EOF

  $ cat > main_native.ml <<EOF
  > let t = Foo_Bar.t
  > EOF

  $ mkdir lib

  $ cat > lib/dune <<EOF
  > (library

  >  (wrapped false))
  > EOF

  $ cat > lib/Foo_Bar.ml <<EOF
  > let t = "Hello World"
  > EOF

  $ dune build output/melange__Main_melange.js
  File "dune", line 4, characters 1-16:
  4 |  (libraries foo)
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Error: The library "foo" was added as a dependency of a melange.emit stanza,
  but this library is not compatible with melange. To fix this, add (modes
  melange) to the library stanza.

Building the native executable does fail as well, as the error is evaluated eagerly

  $ dune build ./main_native.exe
  File "dune", line 4, characters 1-16:
  4 |  (libraries foo)
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Error: The library "foo" was added as a dependency of a melange.emit stanza,
  but this library is not compatible with melange. To fix this, add (modes
